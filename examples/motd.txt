Welcome to Python 3 on CentOS 7.2!

Try out Django:

           **********IMPORTANT!**********
(0) On your host machine, add the following to the hosts file:
    192.168.99.100	vagrant.example.com
    Mac hosts file location: /private/etc/hosts
    Windows hosts file location: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
    If you haven't done so, make sure your SSH key in Vagrant is in stash. If it isn't:
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@yourmailserver.com"
    <Hit enter four times>
    $ cat /home/vagrant/id_rsa.pub
    <Copy and paste that value into your git host, such as GitHub>

(1) Create a virtualenv:
    $ mkvirtualenv myproject
(2) Install Django:
    $ pip install django
(3) Move to your Apache home directory:
    $ cd /vagrant/html
(4) Start your Django project:
    $ django-admin startproject myproject
(5) Enter your project and fire up runserver:
    $ cd myproject
    $ python manage.py runserver 0:8000
(6) Try making your first Django Project; please note, we have completed several of the steps necessary, as you will see:
    https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/

The '/vagrant' directory is shared with your host machine in the location where you ran 'vagrant up'.

Some aliases have been created for you in ~/.bashrc:

(1) Alias for 'python manage.py runserver':
    $ runserver
(2) Color highlighting 'cat':
    $ ccat manage.py

Shutting down your virtualenv and Vagrant:

$ deactivate
$ exit
